    "abstract": "We present a parallel algorithm for k-nearest neighbor graph construction that uses Morton ordering. Experiments show that our approach has the following advantages over existing methods: 1) faster construction of k-nearest neighbor graphs in practice on multicore machines, 2) less space usage, 3) better cache efficiency, 4) ability to handle large data sets, and 5) ease of parallelization and implementation. If the point set has a bounded expansion constant, our algorithm requires one-comparison-based parallel sort of points, according to Morton order plus near-linear additional steps to output the k-nearest neighbor graph.",

    "abstract": "We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both SPH and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume ‘overlap’. We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity and cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO:1 this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require ‘artificial diffusion’ terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow, so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages versus SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced ‘particle noise’ and numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, and sharp shock-capturing. Advantages versus non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors and numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of ‘grid alignment’ effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous discs, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize ‘grid noise’. These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.",

    "abstract": "The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is a large-aperture, wide-field, ground-based survey system that will image the sky in six optical bands from 320 to 1050 nm, uniformly covering approximately \\$18,000\\$deg\\$\\^2\\$ of the sky over 800 times. The LSST is currently under construction on Cerro Pach$\\backslash$’on in Chile, and expected to enter operations in 2022. Once operational, the LSST will explore a wide range of astrophysical questions, from discovering \"killer\" asteroids to examining the nature of Dark Energy. The LSST will generate on average 15 TB of data per night, and will require a comprehensive Data Management system to reduce the raw data to scientifically useful catalogs and images with minimum human intervention. These reductions will result in a real-time alert stream, and eleven data releases over the 10-year duration of LSST operations. To enable this processing, the LSST project is developing a new, general-purpose, high-performance, scalable, well documented, open source data processing software stack for O/IR surveys. Prototypes of this stack are already capable of processing data from existing cameras (e.g., SDSS, DECam, MegaCam), and form the basis of the Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) Survey data reduction pipeline.",

    "abstract": "In many scientific domains, experimental devices or simulation programs generate large volumes of data. The volumes of data may reach hundreds of terabytes and therefore it is impractical to store them on disk systems. Rather they are stored on robotic tape systems that are managed by some mass storage system (MSS). A major bottleneck in analyzing the simulated/collected data is the retrieval of subsets from the tertiary storage system. We describe the architecture and implementation of a Storage Access Coordination System (STACS) designed to optimize the use of a disk cache, and thus minimize the number of files read from tape. We achieve this by using a specialized index to locate the relevant data on tapes, and by coordinating file caching over multiple queries. We focus on a specific application area, a high energy physics data management and analysis environment. STACS was implemented and is being incorporated in an operational system, scheduled to go online at the end of 1999. We also include the results of various tests that demonstrate the benefits and efficiency gained of using the STACS",

    "abstract": "We describe the newly written code GADGET which is suitable both for cosmological simulations of structure formation and for the simulation of interacting galaxies. GADGET evolves self-gravitating collisionless fluids with the traditional N-body approach, and a collisional gas by smoothed particle hydrodynamics. Along with the serial version of the code, we discuss a parallel version that has been designed to run on massively parallel supercomputers with distributed memory. While both versions use a tree algorithm to compute gravitational forces, the serial version of GADGET can optionally employ the special-purpose hardware GRAPE instead of the tree. Periodic boundary conditions are supported by means of an Ewald summation technique. The code uses individual and adaptive timesteps for all particles, and it combines this with a scheme for dynamic tree updates. Due to its Lagrangian nature, GADGET thus allows a very large dynamic range to be bridged, both in space and time. So far, GADGET has been successfully used to run simulations with up to 7.5×107 particles, including cosmological studies of large-scale structure formation, high-resolution simulations of the formation of clusters of galaxies, as well as workstation-sized problems of interacting galaxies. In this study, we detail the numerical algorithms employed, and show various tests of the code. We publicly release both the serial and the massively parallel version of the code.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the ‘tree’ method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community.",

    "abstract": "A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES, is presented. It has been designed to study structure formation in the universe with high spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree based data structure allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART code (Kravtsov et al. 97), with minor differences in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious effects associated to shock waves propagation in the resulting AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of structure formation in a low density LCDM universe are finally reported, with 256\\^3 particles and 4.1 10\\^7 cells in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of 8192\\^3. A convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and individual haloes temperature profiles, shows that numerical results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical predictions in the framework of the halo model.",

    "abstract": "Bitmap indexing, though effective for low cardinality attributes, can be rather costly in storage overhead for high cardinality attributes. Range-based bitmap (RBM) indexing can be used to reduce this storage overhead. The attribute values are partitioned into ranges and a bitmap vector is used to represent a range. With RBM, however, the number of records assigned to different ranges can be highly uneven, resulting in non-uniform search times for different queries. We present and evaluate a dynamic bucket expansion and contraction (DBEC) approach to simultaneously constructing range-based bitmap indexes for multiple high-cardinality attributes. Simulations are conducted to evaluate this DBEC approach. Both synthetic and real data are used in the simulations. The results show that (1) with highly skewed data, DBEC performs quite well compared with a simple approach and (2) DBEC compares favorably with the optimal approach",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>We present a new implementation of the tracer particles algorithm based on a Monte Carlo approach for the Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement code R<jats:sc>AMSES</jats:sc>. The purpose of tracer particles is to keep track of where fluid elements originate in Eulerian mesh codes, so as to follow their Lagrangian trajectories and re-processing history. We provide a comparison to the more commonly used velocity-based tracer particles, and show that the Monte Carlo approach reproduces the gas distribution much more accurately. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the properties of the distribution of tracer particles in the gas and report that it follows a Poisson law. We extend these Monte Carlo gas tracer particles to tracer particles for the stars and black holes, so that they can exchange mass back and forth between themselves. With such a scheme, we can follow the full cycle of baryons, that is, from gas-forming stars to the release of mass back to the surrounding gas multiple times, or accretion of gas onto black holes. The overall impact on computation time is ∼3% per tracer per initial cell. As a proof of concept, we study an astrophysical science case – the dual accretion modes of galaxies at high redshifts –, which highlights how the scheme yields information hitherto unavailable. These tracer particles will allow us to study complex astrophysical systems where both efficiency of shock-capturing Godunov schemes and a Lagrangian follow-up of the fluid are required simultaneously.</jats:p>",

This is succeeded by the rapid disruption of these pancake sheets through thin-shell instabilities evolving naturally from minute ram pressure imbalances. This eventually creates high-density blobs accompanied by thread-like features from shear flow effects. The further evolution of the blobs follows the magnetic field lines, such that a dynamical realignment with the background magnetic field appears.

This ambient field is known to drive magneto-rotational turbulence in the disk bulk, but it is also responsible for launching magnetised outflows at the origin of astrophysical jets. Yet, the interplay between turbulence and outflows is not understood. In particular, the vertical structure and long-term (secular) evolution of such a system lack quantitative predictions. It is, nevertheless, this secular evolution which is proposed to explain time variability in many accreting systems such as FuOr, X-ray binaries, and novae like systems.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Aims.</jats:italic> We seek to constraint the structure and long-term evolution of turbulent astrophysical disks subject to magnetised outflows in the non-relativistic regime. More specifically we aim to characterise the mechanism driving accretion, the dynamics of the disk atmosphere, the role played by the outflow, and the long-term evolution of mass and magnetic flux distributions.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Methods.</jats:italic> We computed and analysed global 3D ideal magnetohydrynamic (MHD) simulations of an accretion disk threaded by a large-scale magnetic field. We measured the turbulent state of the system by Reynolds averaging the ideal MHD equations and evaluate the role of the turbulent terms in the equilibrium of the system. We then computed the transport of mass, angular momentum, and magnetic fields in the disk to characterise its secular evolution. Finally, we performed a parameter exploration survey in order to characterise how the transport properties depend on the disk properties.</jats:p>\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results.</jats:italic> We find that weakly magnetised disks drive jets that carry a small fraction of the disk angular momentum away. The mass-weighted accretion speed remains subsonic, although there is always an upper turbulent atmospheric region where transsonic accretion takes place. We show that this turbulence is driven by a strongly magnetised version of the magneto-rotational instability. The internal disk structure therefore appears drastically different from the conventional hydrostatic picture. We expect that the turbulent atmosphere region will lead to non-thermal features in the emission spectra from compact objects. In addition, we show that the disk is subject to a secular viscous-type instability, which leads to the formation of long-lived ring-like structures in the disk surface density distribution. This instability is likely connected to the magnetic field transport. Finally, we show that for all of the parameters explored, the ambient magnetic field is always dragged inward in the disk at a velocity which increases with the disk magnetisation. Beyond a threshold on the latter, the disk undergoes a profound radial readjustment. It leads to the formation of an inner accretion-ejection region with a supersonic mass-weighted accretion speed and where the magnetic field distribution becomes steady and reaches a magnitude near equipartition with the thermal pressure. This inner structure shares many properties with the jet emitting disk model. Overall, these results pave the way for quantitative self-consistent secular disk models.</jats:p>",

Evolution of the condensations towards the topological dips of the magnetic flux rope is a consequence of these condensations initially forming out of pressure balance with their surroundings. From the baroclinicity distributions, smaller-scale rotational motions are inferred within forming and evolving condensations. Upon the complete condensation of a prominence ‘monolith’, the slow descent of this plasma towards lower heights appears consistent with the mass-slippage mechanism driven by episodes of both local current diffusion and magnetic reconnection.</jats:p>",

Visualisation of SPH data is more complicated than for grid-based codes because the data are defined on a set of irregular points and therefore requires a mapping procedure to a two dimensional pixel array. This means that, in practise, many authors simply produce particle plots which offer a rather crude representation of the simulation output. Here we describe the techniques and algorithms which are utilised in <jats:sc>SPLASH</jats:sc> in order to provide the user with a fast, interactive and meaningful visualisation of one, two and three dimensional SPH results.</jats:p>",

The radius of the steepest slope in the dark matter, commonly used as a proxy for the splashback radius, is located at $\\sim \\, r_{200 \\rm m}$; the strength and location of this feature depends on the recent mass accretion rate, in good agreement with previous work. Interestingly, the stellar distribution (or intracluster light, ICL) also has a well-defined edge, which is directly related to the splashback radius of the halo. Thus, detecting the edge of the ICL can provide an independent measure of the physical boundary of the halo, and the recent mass accretion rate. We show that these caustics can also be seen in the projected density profiles, but care must be taken to account for the influence of substructures and other non-diffuse material, which can bias and/or weaken the signal of the steepest slope. This is particularly important for the stellar material, which has a higher fraction bound in subhaloes than the dark matter. Finally, we show that the ‘stellar splashback’ feature is located beyond current observational constraints on the ICL, but these large projected distances (≫1 Mpc) and low surface brightnesses (μ ≫ 32 mag arcsec−2) can be reached with upcoming observational facilities such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and Euclid.</jats:p>",

In previous work, we showed that dynamical interactions alone produced too few low-mass binaries compared to observations. We therefore implement an initial population of binaries in the coupled magnetohydrodynamics and direct N-body star cluster formation code torch. We compare simulations with, and without, initial binary populations and follow the dynamical evolution of the binary population in both sets of simulations, finding that both dynamical formation and destruction of binaries take place. Even in the first few million years of star formation, we find that an initial population of binaries is needed at all masses to reproduce observed binary fractions for binaries with mass ratios above the q ≥ 0.1 detection limit. Our simulations also indicate that dynamical interactions in the presence of gas during cluster formation modify the initial distributions towards binaries with smaller primary masses, larger mass ratios, smaller semimajor axes and larger eccentricities. Systems formed dynamically do not have the same properties as the initial systems, and systems formed dynamically in the presence of an initial population of binaries differ from those formed in simulations with single stars only. Dynamical interactions during the earliest stages of star cluster formation are important for determining the properties of binary star systems.</jats:p>",

We find that most of the collisional O vi, by mass, resides in the relatively thin boundaries of the photoionized streams. Thus, we predict that a reason previous work has found the ionization mechanism of O vi so difficult to determine is because the distinction between the two methods coincides with the distinction between two significant phases of the CGM. We discuss how the results are in agreement with analytic predictions of stream and boundary properties, and their compatibility with observations. This allows us to predict the profiles of O vi and other ions in future CGM observations and provides a toy model for interpreting them.</jats:p>",

Using the eagle suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we present a thorough exploration of the physical properties of gas accreting on to haloes – namely, its spatial characteristics, density, temperature, and metallicity. Classifying accretion as ‘hot’ or ‘ cold’ based on a temperature cut-off 105.5 K, we find that the covering fraction (fcov) of cold-mode accreting gas is significantly lower than the hot-mode, with z = 0 fcov values of ${\\approx}50{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$ and ${\\approx}80{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$, respectively. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback in eagle reduces inflow fcov values by ${\\approx}10{{\\ \\rm per\\ cent}}$, with outflows decreasing the solid angle available for accretion flows. Classifying inflow by particle history, we find that gas on first-infall on to a halo is metal depleted by ≈2 dex compared to pre-processed gas, which we find to mimic the circum-galactic medium (CGM) in terms of metal content. We also show that high (low) halo-scale gas accretion rates are associated with metal-poor (rich) CGM in haloes below $10^{12}\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot }$, and that variation in halo-scale gas accretion rates may offer a physical explanation for the enhanced scatter in the star-forming main sequence at low (${\\lesssim}10^{9}\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot }$) and high (${\\gtrsim}10^{10}\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot }$) stellar masses. Our results highlight how gas inflow influences several halo- and galaxy-scale properties, and the need to combine kinematic and chemical data in order to confidently break the degeneracy between accreting and outgoing gas in CGM observations.</jats:p>",

The choice of variable to smooth in SPH has been the topic of contention, with smoothed pressure (P-SPH) being introduced to reduce errors at contact discontinuities relative to smoothed density schemes. Smoothed pressure schemes produce excellent results in isolated hydrodynamics tests; in more complex situations however, especially when coupling to the ‘sub-grid’ physics and multiple time-stepping used in many state-of-the-art astrophysics simulations, these schemes produce large force errors that can easily evade detection as they do not manifest as energy non-conservation. Here, two scenarios are evaluated: the injection of energy into the fluid (common for stellar feedback) and radiative cooling. In the former scenario, force and energy conservation errors manifest (of the same order as the injected energy), and in the latter large force errors that change rapidly over a few time-steps lead to instability in the fluid (of the same order as the energy lost to cooling). Potential ways to remedy these issues are explored with solutions generally leading to large increases in computational cost. Schemes using a density-based formulation do not create these instabilities and as such it is recommended that they are preferred over pressure-based solutions when combined with an energy diffusion term to reduce errors at contact discontinuities.</jats:p>",

In the standard cosmological paradigm, galactic bars should be slowed down by dynamical friction from the dark matter halo. This friction depends on the galaxy’s physical properties in a complex way, making it impossible to formulate analytically. Fortunately, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations provide an excellent statistical population of galaxies, letting us quantify how simulated galactic bars evolve within dark matter haloes. We measure bar strengths, lengths, and pattern speeds in barred galaxies in state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE projects, using techniques similar to those used observationally. We then compare our results with the largest available observational sample at redshift z = 0. We show that the tension between these simulations and observations in the ratio of corotation radius to bar length is 12.62σ (TNG50), 13.56σ (TNG100), 2.94σ (EAGLE50), and 9.69σ (EAGLE100), revealing for the first time that the significant tension reported previously persists in the recently released TNG50. The lower statistical tension in EAGLE50 is actually caused by it only having five galaxies suitable for our analysis, but all four simulations give similar statistics for the bar pattern speed distribution. In addition, the fraction of disc galaxies with bars is similar between TNG50 and TNG100, though somewhat above EAGLE100. The simulated bar fraction and its trend with stellar mass both differ greatly from observations. These dramatic disagreements cast serious doubt on whether galaxies actually have massive cold dark matter haloes, with their associated dynamical friction acting on galactic bars.</jats:p>",

However, almost all observed galactic bars are fast in terms of the ratio between corotation radius and bar length. Here, we explicitly display an 8σ tension between the observed distribution of this ratio and that in the EAGLE simulation at redshift 0. We also compare the evolution of Newtonian galactic discs embedded in DM haloes to their evolution in three extended gravity theories: Milgromian Dynamics (MOND), a model of non-local gravity, and a scalar–tensor–vector gravity theory (MOG). Although our models start with the same initial baryonic distribution and rotation curve, the long-term evolution is different. The bar instability happens more violently in MOND compared to the other models. There are some common features between the extended gravity models, in particular the negligible role played by dynamical friction − which plays a key role in the DM model. Partly for this reason, all extended gravity models predict weaker bars and faster bar pattern speeds compared to the DM case. Although the absence of strong bars in our idealized, isolated extended gravity simulations is in tension with observations, they reproduce the strong observational preference for ‘fast’ bar pattern speeds, which we could not do with DM. We confirm previous findings that apparently ‘ultrafast’ bars can be due to bar-spiral arm alignment leading to an overestimated bar length, especially in extended gravity scenarios where the bar is already fast.</jats:p>",

Starting from a model previously developed by our group, here we introduce several improvements to the prescriptions for cluster formation and feedback, then test these updates using a large suite of cosmological simulations of Milky Way mass galaxies. We perform a differential analysis with the goal of understanding how each of the updates affects star cluster populations. Two key parameters are the momentum boost of supernova feedback fboost and star formation efficiency per free-fall time ϵff. We find that fboost has a strong influence on the galactic star formation rate, with higher values leading to less star formation. The efficiency ϵff does not have a significant impact on the global star formation rate, but dramatically changes cluster properties, with increasing ϵff leading to a higher maximum cluster mass, shorter age spread of stars within clusters, and higher integrated star formation efficiencies. We also explore the redshift evolution of the observable cluster mass function, finding that most massive clusters have formed at high redshift z &amp;gt; 4. Extrapolation of cluster disruption to z = 0 produces good agreement with both the Galactic globular cluster mass function and age–metallicity relation.

A series of multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations of ejecta–donor interaction have been performed in previous studies most of which adopt either a simplified analytical model or the W7 model to represent a normal SN Ia explosion. Whether different explosion mechanisms can significantly affect the results of ejecta–donor interaction is still unclear. In this work, we simulate hydrodynamical ejecta interactions with a main-sequence (MS) donor star in two dimensions for two near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion models of SNe Ia, the W7 and N100 models. We find that about 0.30 and $0.37\\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot }$ of hydrogen-rich material are stripped from a $2.5\\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ donor star in a 2 d orbit by the SN Ia explosion in simulations with the W7 deflagration and N100 delayed-detonation explosion model, respectively. The donor star receives a kick of about 74 and $86\\, \\mathrm{km}\\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, respectively, in each case. The modal velocity, about $500\\, \\mathrm{km}\\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, of stripped hydrogen-rich material in the N100 model is faster than the W7 model, with modal velocity of about $350\\, \\mathrm{km\\, s^{-1}}$, by a factor 1.4. Based on our results, we conclude that the choice of near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion model for normal SNe Ia seems to not significantly alter the ejecta–donor interaction for a given MS donor model, at least in 2D.</jats:p>",

Here, we introduce and compare two separate dust evolution models (labelled ‘Elemental’ and ‘Species’), based on recent approaches, incorporated into the gizmo code and coupled with fire-2 stellar feedback and interstellar medium physics. Both models account for turbulent dust diffusion, stellar production of dust, dust growth via gas-dust accretion, and dust destruction from time-resolved supernovae, thermal sputtering in hot gas, and astration. The ‘Elemental’ model tracks the evolution of generalized dust species and utilizes a simple, ‘tunable’ dust growth routine, while the ‘Species’ model tracks the evolution of specific dust species with set chemical compositions and incorporates a physically motivated, two-phase dust growth routine. We test and compare these models in an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and find that while both produce reasonable galaxy-integrated dust-to-metals (D/Z) ratios and predict gas-dust accretion as the main dust growth mechanism, a chemically motivated model is needed to reproduce the observed scaling relation between individual element depletions and D/Z with column density and local gas density. We also find the inclusion of theoretical metallic iron and O-bearing dust species are needed in the case of specific dust species in order to match observations of O and Fe depletions, and the integration of a sub-resolution dense molecular gas/CO scheme is needed to both match observed C depletions and ensure carbonaceous dust is not overproduced in dense environments.</jats:p>",

In the high redshift Universe, most of this gas infall is expected to be dominated by cold filamentary flows which connect deep down inside haloes, and, hence, to the vicinity of galaxies. Such cold flows are important since they dominate the mass and angular momentum acquisition that can make up rotationally-supported discs at high-redshifts. We study the angular momentum acquisition of gas into galaxies, and in particular, the torques acting on the accretion flows, using hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of high-resolution zoomed-in haloes of a few $10^{11}\\, \\rm M_\\odot$ at z = 2. Torques can be separated into those of gravitational origin, and hydrodynamical ones driven by pressure gradients. We find that coherent gravitational torques dominate over pressure torques in the cold phase, and are hence responsible for the spin-down and realignment of this gas. Pressure torques display small-scale fluctuations of significant amplitude, but with very little coherence on the relevant galaxy or halo-scale that would otherwise allow them to effectively re-orientate the gas flows. Dark matter torques dominate gravitational torques outside the galaxy, while within the galaxy, the baryonic component dominates. The circum-galactic medium emerges as the transition region for angular momentum re-orientation of the cold component towards the central galaxy’s mid-plane.</jats:p>",

Measuring the relative velocity of haloes with respect to their ambient gas, we find that one-tenth of the haloes are expected to be unable to accrete external gas due to its fast flow passed them (so called ‘fast flow haloes’). These are typically located near void walls. We determine that these haloes have recently crossed the void wall and are still moving away from it. Their motion counter to that of ambient gas falling towards the void wall results in fast flows that make external gas accretion very challenging, and often cause partial gas loss via the resultant ram pressures. Using an analytical approach, we model the impact of such ram pressures on the gas inside haloes of different masses. A halo’s external gas accretion is typically cut off, with partial stripping of halo gas. For masses below a few times 109 M⊙, their halo gas is heavily truncated but not completely stripped. We identify numerous examples of haloes with a clear jelly-fish like gas morphology, indicating their surrounding gas is being swept away, cutting them off from further external accretion. These results highlight how, even in the relatively low densities of void walls, a fraction of galaxies can interact with large-scale flows in a manner that has consequences for their gas content and ability to accrete gas.</jats:p>",

We show results for a wide range of test problems for HD, radiation, and coupled RHD. On uniform grids in 3D on a single GPU, our code achieves &amp;gt;250 million hydrodynamic updates per second and almost 40 million radiation hydrodynamic updates per second. For RHD problems on uniform grids in 3D, our code scales from 4 to 256 GPUs with an efficiency of 76 per cent. The code is publicly released under an open-source license on GitHub.</jats:p>",

The particle-based SPH technique allows an intuitive and simple formulation of hydrodynamics that has excellent conservation properties and can be coupled to self-gravity with high accuracy. The Lagrangian character of SPH allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a property that makes the scheme ideal for many application areas in astrophysics, where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the derivation of the basic SPH equations in their modern formulation, and give an overview about extensions of SPH developed to treat physics such as radiative transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics, or magnetic fields. We also briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of SPH in astrophysical research. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the accuracy of SPH for different hydrodynamical problems, including measurements of its convergence rate for important classes of problems. </jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> On the path to exascale the landscape of computer device architectures and corresponding programming models has become much more diverse. While various low-level performance portable programming models are available, support at the application level lacks behind. To address this issue, we present the performance portable block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework Parthenon, derived from the well-tested and widely used Athena++ astrophysical magnetohydrodynamics code, but generalized to serve as the foundation for a variety of downstream multi-physics codes. Parthenon adopts the Kokkos programming model, and provides various levels of abstractions from multidimensional variables, to packages defining and separating components, to launching of parallel compute kernels. Parthenon allocates all data in device memory to reduce data movement, supports the logical packing of variables and mesh blocks to reduce kernel launch overhead, and employs one-sided, asynchronous MPI calls to reduce communication overhead in multi-node simulations. Using a hydrodynamics miniapp, we demonstrate weak and strong scaling on various architectures including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, Intel and AMD x86 CPUs, IBM Power9 CPUs, as well as Fujitsu A64FX CPUs. At the largest scale on Frontier (the first TOP500 exascale machine), the miniapp reaches a total of 1.7 × 10<jats:sup>13</jats:sup> zone-cycles/s on 9216 nodes (73,728 logical GPUs) at [Formula: see text] weak scaling parallel efficiency (starting from a single node). In combination with being an open, collaborative project, this makes Parthenon an ideal framework to target exascale simulations in which the downstream developers can focus on their specific application rather than on the complexity of handling massively-parallel, device-accelerated AMR. </jats:p>",

We here describe the algorithms used for each of these processes. We denote this integrated package Torch. We then use this novel numerical method to simulate the formation and early evolution of several examples of open clusters of ∼1000 stars formed from clouds with a mass range of 10<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> \n                  <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub> to 10<jats:sup>5</jats:sup> \n                  <jats:italic>M</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>. Analyzing the effects of stellar feedback on the gas and stars of the natal clusters, we find that in these examples, the stellar clusters are resilient to disruption, even in the presence of intense feedback. This can even slightly increase the amount of dense, Jeans unstable gas by sweeping up shells; thus, a stellar wind strong enough to trap its own H <jats:sc>ii</jats:sc> region shows modest triggering of star formation. Our clusters are born moderately mass segregated, an effect enhanced by feedback, and retained after the ejection of their natal gas, in agreement with observations.</jats:p>",

In this version, a new technique is developed to model higher gas densities by parameterizing the probability distribution function (PDF) of the gas density in higher-resolution simulations run with the pseudo-Lagrangian, Voronoi mesh code <jats:sc>arepo</jats:sc>. The parameterized PDFs are used as a look-up table, and reach higher densities than in previous work. <jats:sc>sígame</jats:sc> v3 is tested on redshift <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> = 0 galaxies drawn from the <jats:sc>simba</jats:sc> cosmological simulation for eight FIR emission lines tracing vastly different phases of the interstellar medium. This version of <jats:sc>sígame</jats:sc> includes dust radiative transfer with S<jats:sc>kirt</jats:sc> and high-resolution photoionization models with C<jats:sc>loudy</jats:sc>, the latter sampled according to the density PDF of the <jats:sc>arepo</jats:sc> simulations to augment the densities in the cosmological simulation. The quartile distributions of the predicted line luminosities overlap with the observed range for nearby galaxies of similar star formation rate (SFR) for all but two emission lines: [O <jats:sc>i</jats:sc>]63 and CO(3–2), which are overestimated by median factors of 1.3 and 1.0 dex, respectively, compared to the observed line–SFR relation of mixed-type galaxies. We attribute the remaining disagreement with observations to the lack of precise attenuation of the interstellar light on sub-grid scales (≲200 pc) and differences in sample selection.</jats:p>",

We find that mixing predominantly alters the distribution along the <jats:italic>K</jats:italic> direction and illustrate how the formalism can be used to model mixing and cooling for fluid elements originating in the cloud. We further confirm and generalize a previously suggested criterion for cloud growth in the presence of radiative cooling and demonstrate that the shape of the cooling curve, particularly at the low-temperature end, can play an important role in controlling condensation. Moreover, we discuss the capacity of our approach to generalize such a criterion to apply to additional sets of physics and to build intuition for the impact of subtle higher-order effects not directly addressed by the criterion.</jats:p>",

Inflation and phase transitions in the early universe could give rise to such fields with unique characteristics. We investigate the magnetohydrodynamic evolution of these magnetogenesis scenarios with cosmological simulations. We evolve inflation-generated magnetic fields either as (i) uniform (homogeneous) or as (ii) scale-invariant stochastic fields, and phase-transition-generated ones either as (iii) helical or as (iv) nonhelical fields from the radiation-dominated epoch. We find that the final distribution of magnetic fields in the simulated cosmic web shows a dependence on the initial strength and the topology of the seed field. Thus, the observed field configuration retains information on the initial conditions at the moment of the field generation. If detected, PMF observations would open a new window for indirect probes of the early universe. The differences between the competing models are revealed on the scale of galaxy clusters, bridges, as well as filaments and voids. The distinctive spectral evolution of different seed fields produces imprints on the correlation length today. We discuss how the differences between rotation measures from highly ionized regions can potentially be probed with forthcoming surveys.</jats:p>",

We observe 73,523 individual primordial stars within 3313 distinct regions forming 2110 second-generation enriched star clusters by <jats:italic>z</jats:italic> ≥ 12 within a combined 177.25 Mpc<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> volume across three simulations. The regions that lead to enriched star formation can contain ≳150 primordial stars, with 80% of regions having experienced combinations of primordial Type II, hypernovae, and/or pair-instability supernovae. Primordial supernovae enriched 0.8% of the volume, with 2% of enriched gas enriched by later-generation stars. We determine the extent of a primordial stellar region by its metal-rich or ionized hydrogen surrounding cloud; the metal-rich and ionized regions have time-dependent average radii <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> ≲ 3<jats:strike> </jats:strike>kpc. 7 and 17% of regions have <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> &gt; 7 kpc for metal-rich and ionized radii, respectively. We find that the metallicity distribution function of second-generation stars overlaps that of subsequent Population II star formation, spanning metal-deficient (∼7.94 × 10<jats:sup>−8</jats:sup> \n                  <jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>) to supersolar (∼3.71 <jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>), and that 30.5% of second-generation stars have <jats:italic>Z</jats:italic> &gt; 10<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> \n                  <jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>\n                  <jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>. We find that the metallicity of second-generation stars depends on progenitor configuration, with metals from pair-instability supernovae contributing to the most metal-rich clusters; these clusters form promptly after the supernova event. Finally, we create an interpretable regression model to predict the radius of the metal-rich influence of Population III star systems within the first 7–18 Myr after the first Population III stars form in the region.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Cloud-wind interactions are common in the interstellar and circumgalactic media. Many studies have used simulations of such interactions to investigate the effect of particular physical processes, but the impact of the choice of hydrodynamics solver has largely been overlooked. Here we study the cloud-wind interaction, also known as the \"blob test\", using seven different hydrodynamics solvers: Three flavours of SPH, a moving mesh, adaptive mesh refinement and two meshless schemes. The evolution of masses in dense gas and intermediate-temperature gas, as well as the covering fraction of intermediate-temperature gas, are systematically compared for initial density contrasts of 10 and 100, and five numerical resolutions. To isolate the differences due to the hydrodynamics solvers, we use idealised non-radiative simulations without physical conduction. We find large differences between these methods. SPH methods show slower dispersal of the cloud, particularly for the higher density contrast, but faster convergence, especially for the lower density contrast. Predictions for the intermediate-temperature gas differ particularly strongly, also between non-SPH codes, and converge most slowly. We conclude that the hydrodynamical interaction between a dense cloud and a supersonic wind remains an unsolved problem. Studies aiming to understand the physics or observational signatures of cloud-wind interactions should test the robustness of their results by comparing different hydrodynamics solvers.",

    "abstract": "The angular momentum of galaxies controls the kinematics of their stars, which in turn drives observable quantities such as the apparent radius, the bulge fraction, and the alignment with other nearby structures. To show how angular momentum of galaxies is determined, we build high (${35}\\,\\mathrm{pc}$) resolution numerical experiments in which we increase or decrease the angular momentum of the Lagrangian patches in the early universe. We simulate three galaxies over their histories from $z=200$ to $z=2$, each with five different choices for the angular momentum (fifteen simulations in total). Our results show that altering early-universe angular momentum changes the timing and orbital parameters of mergers, which in turn changes the total stellar angular momentum within a galaxy's virial radius in a predictable manner. Of our three galaxies, one has no large satellite at $z=2$; in this case, the specific angular momentum is concentrated in the central galaxy. We modify its stellar angular momentum over $0.7\\,\\mathrm{dex}$ (from $61$ to $320\\,\\mathrm{kpc.km.s^{-1}}$) and show that this causes its effective radius to grow by $40\\,\\%$, its $v/σ$ parameter to grow by a factor $\\times 2.6$ and its bulge fraction to decrease from $0.72$ to $0.57$. The ability to control angular momentum will allow future studies to probe the causal origin of scaling relations between galaxy mass, angular momentum and morphology, and to better understand the origin of galactic intrinsic alignments.",

    "abstract": "Grant proposal for NSF SI2-SSI for yt project ( http://yt-project.org/ ) development. Awarded as OAC-1663914.<br>http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1663914<br>ABSTRACT:<br>Scientific discovery across the physical sciences is increasingly dependent on the analysis of volumetric - or three-dimensional - data, that may come from a supercomputer simulation, direct measurement, or mathematical models. Researchers typically seek to extract meaningful insights from this data by visualizing and analyzing it in various ways. The ways in which scientists process volumetric data are actually quite similar across domains, but cross-disciplinary knowledge transfer and tool development is blocked by barriers of terminology. This project seeks to enhance an analysis and visualization toolkit named yt that is currently primarily used for astrophysical simulations. yt allows scientists to access and analyze data at several different levels by providing an interface that is designed to answer questions motivated by the underlying scientific problem, while worrying less about details such data formats, specific analysis techniques etc. yt's utilization in computational astrophysics has dramatically increased access to advanced algorithms for both visualization and analysis, and fostered the growth of a community of researchers sharing techniques and results. This project seeks to make yt available and adopted by scientists in other domains of science thus reproducing its success in astrophysics in these other science domains. This project will expand the yt community beyond theoretical astrophysics and enable and promote collaboration and advanced data analysis in the fields of meteorology, seismology and global tomography, observational astronomy, hydrology and oceanography, and plasma physics. <br>Improvements to the yt project will proceed along four principal technical avenues. The first is to develop a system that adapts the way yt presents data via a set of domain contexts that encode the ontology, domain-specific vocabulary, and common analysis tasks for a given field of study. This will include creating a domain context system as well as a set of five pilot domain contexts developed in collaboration with domain practitioners. The second is to overhaul the yt field system, adding more versatility and enabling significant optimizations. Thirdly, the project team will implement non-spatial indexing schemes, providing methods for accessing and analyzing data that is not organized according to the standard spatial axes. The final improvement will be the development of a non-local analysis system, allowing generalized path traversal as well as domain convolutions. To ensure wide dissemination and use of these improved capabilities, the team will design domain-specific documentation and training materials, and organize outreach and training events for early-career researchers. This will consist of both hands-on technical workshops and curricula developed in collaboration with Data Carpentry for utilization at other institutions. This combination of technical developments and social investments has been designed to ensure both readiness of the software and engagement of the targeted research communities.",
