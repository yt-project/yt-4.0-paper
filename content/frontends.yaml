    For visualization purposes, yt treats it similarly to an SPH dataset; some efforts

  comments: 'ART, or ''NMSU-ART'' as it is occasionally referred to internally, is
    an octree-based code that is often used for cosmology simulations and galaxy formation
    simulations.

    yt supports two sets of data formats in the NMSU-ART family.

    The first is a particle-only format, where the particles are stored independently
    of any gas structure.

    The second is the hydro data format, wherein gas values are stored organized into
    an octree.

    Each of these constitutes a different indexing system, sharing similar datatypes,
    units, and so forth.

  comments: 'The ARTIO frontend, which shares some ancestry with the `art` or ''NMSU-ART''
    frontend, utilizes a special purpose library for input/output operations called
    `libartio`, which is bundled with yt.


    Utilizing `libartio` is interesting from a historical perspective, as it provided
    an opportunity to reorganize the way that yt understood indexing of octree datasets.

    Whereas previously yt required a full understanding of data distribution, the
    `artio` frontend outsourced much of that to the internal library, which it regarded
    as essentially an opaque API.

    Reducing the amount of internal bookkeepping that yt had to do provided a lighter-weight
    interface to the data, which in turn has enabled other frontends to be created
    using opaque APIs.

  comments: 'Enzo was the very first code supported by yt, and while many remnants
    of that have been removed, many still remain.

    During the development of yt 3.0 in particular, many "enzo-isms" were removed;
    however, as Enzo uses a patch-based grid data format, much of the naming conventions
    for grid objects still mirror those in use in Enzo.

    These include names such as `GridLeftEdge` and `ActiveDimensions` (which refers
    to the dimensions not including ghost zones).


    There are several ''sub-frontends'' within the Enzo frontend; these include dedicated
    1D and 2D readers, as well as historical frontends (of varying functionality)
    for reading HDF4, ''unpacked'' HDF5 and other sub-dialects of Enzo.
